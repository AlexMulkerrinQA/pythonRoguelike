issues with colour in 64-bit python might be fixed by getting BigNum.py

is it the case that globals in Python can be referenced anywhere but only changed if explicitely assigned in a function?

basic 16 colour codes:
all start with \e[ and end with m
foreground {0-1};{30-37};
background {40-48}

256 colour mode is gained with \e[38;5;{0-255}m for foreground, \e[48;5;{0-255}m for background

def setBackGround(colourID):
	call("echo", '-e', "\e[48;5;" + colourID + "m")
	
use:
from subprocess import call
call(['echo','-e','\e[48;5;35mTesting\e[m'])
